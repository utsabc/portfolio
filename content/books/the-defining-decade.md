# The Defining Decade by Meg Jay

## Notes

The book lays the foundational argument that the twenties are the pillars of stability on top of which our life gets built on. It can be very well be underwhelming that the time in twenties can be seen as years of extended teenage-hood expecting and extended period of freedom, but this can be as counter intuitive as it can possibly be.

This can be analogous to a differential equation where a small change in input can cause massive changes in the output.

It is important that we acknowledge this period of self discovery and exploration but this also means that we generate capital *(identity capital)* which sort of becomes a currency which we use in later part of our life and define the trajectory of our life.

## Key takeaways

- **Identity Capital** - It is important for us to leverage the time in our 20s to accumulate identity capital. What do we mean by identity capital, for an individual this would mean picking up valuable experiences in terms of experiences, work and skills, rather than superfluous ones.
    - Identity capital is our collection of personal assets. It is the repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time. These are the investments we make in ourselves, the things we do well enough, or long enough they become part of who we are.
    - Some Identity capital goes on our resumes like degrees, jobs, test scores etc. Other identity capitals are more personal like how we speak, where we are form and how we solve problems, how we look.
    - Identity capital is how we build ourselves bit by bit over time. Most importantly it is the currency we bring in adult marketplace

## Quotes

> Identity capital is the currency with which we use to metaphorically buy jobs, relationships and other things we want in adult marketplace
