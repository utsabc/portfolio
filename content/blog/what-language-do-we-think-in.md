# What Language Do We Think In?  

Here’s a fun question that’s kept me up at night more times than I’d like to admit:  
**What language do we actually think in?**  

I mean, we all think — about food, work, people, random shower thoughts, even weird “what ifs.” But what’s the medium of those thoughts? Do we think in English (or whatever our native tongue is)? Do we think in pictures? In feelings? Or are thoughts abstract blobs that only take shape when we put them into words?  

This post is my (very humble) attempt to unpack some of these questions, drawing from bits of linguistics, psychology, and a little literature.

## The Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis (a.k.a. Linguistic Relativity)  

Academics have a name for this puzzle: **Linguistic Relativity**, better known as the *Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis.*  

At its core, it asks: does the language we speak shape the way we think? Or do our thoughts exist independently, with language just tagging along for expression?  

There are two main versions:  

### 1. The Strong Version  
This one’s bold: **language determines thought.**  

For example, researchers once looked at the Hopi people in New Guinea, whose language has no grammatical tense. The early claim was that the Hopi didn’t perceive time the way we do. But later studies showed that wasn’t true—they just expressed time differently. So while catchy, this “strong” version doesn’t really hold up.  

### 2. The Weak Version  
A bit more reasonable: **language influences thought.**  

Here’s a fun experiment: imagine the sentence *“A cop chases a thief.”* Did you picture the cop running from left to right? If so, it might be because you read left to right. In countries where languages flow right to left, people often imagine the opposite.  

So while language doesn’t cage our minds, it *does* nudge the way we frame ideas.

## But What If It’s the Other Way Around?  

What if thoughts shape language, not the other way around? There are theories here too.  

### Universalism  
This flips the strong version on its head: **thought determines language.** You need the concept before you can express it.  

But again, it’s not perfect. Take another New Guinea language that has only two words for colors: one for “warm” shades and one for “cool” ones. Does that mean speakers literally can’t see red, green, or blue? Of course not—biology says otherwise. Even chimpanzees can distinguish colors without words for them. So thought clearly exists without language.  

### Piaget’s Theory  
Psychologist Jean Piaget added a more nuanced idea: children’s thoughts shape their language development.  

Example: when a toddler realizes that their parents still exist even when they leave the room, they invent or learn words like *“gone”* or *“missing.”* Cognition comes first, words follow.

## Thoughts and Language as Separate  

Another interesting take comes from Lev Vygotsky, who argued that **thought and language start separately.** Only later, with experience and development, do we integrate them. In other words: babies think before they speak, and then slowly merge the two worlds.

## Enter Orwell: Can Language Control Thought?  

This debate isn’t just academic. Literature has played with it too.  

In *1984*, George Orwell imagined *Newspeak*, a language engineered by a totalitarian government to limit people’s ability to think rebellious thoughts. Words like *“freedom”* or *“democracy”* were stripped out. If you don’t have the words, can you even form the idea?  

It’s chilling to think about. If you grow up never hearing the word *“freedom”*, does the concept still live in your mind? Or does language gatekeep what we’re able to imagine?  

And here’s the scarier thought: is something like this happening to us right now? With misinformation flooding our feeds, carefully designed ads reshaping our desires, and political campaigns twisting words into unrecognizable forms—are our thoughts being boxed in by the language we consume?  

Maybe Orwell wasn’t just writing fiction.

## So, What’s the Answer?  

Honestly? There isn’t one.  

The question of whether language shapes thought or thought shapes language has been debated for centuries. Some evidence supports influence, some supports independence, and most experts agree it’s not a simple either/or.  

But one thing’s clear: **language and thought are deeply entangled.** Whether words come first or thoughts do, the two dance together to make us the conscious beings we are.  

And maybe that’s the most important takeaway—not to settle the debate, but to stay aware of how the words around us shape what (and how) we think.
