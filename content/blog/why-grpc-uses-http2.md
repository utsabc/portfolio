# Why gRPC Uses HTTP2

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 as its transport protocol. This choice isn't arbitraryâ€”it's based on several key technical advantages that HTTP/2 provides over its predecessor.

## Key Advantages of HTTP/2

### 1. Multiplexing
HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single TCP connection. This eliminates the head-of-line blocking problem that plagued HTTP/1.1 and significantly improves performance.

### 2. Binary Protocol
Unlike HTTP/1.1's text-based format, HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol. This makes parsing more efficient and reduces the overhead of text processing.

### 3. Header Compression
HTTP/2 includes HPACK compression for headers, which reduces bandwidth usage, especially important for microservices that make many small requests.

### 4. Server Push
HTTP/2's server push capability allows servers to proactively send resources to clients, reducing latency in certain scenarios.

## gRPC's Implementation

gRPC leverages these HTTP/2 features to provide:

- **Efficient streaming**: Both unary and streaming RPCs benefit from HTTP/2's multiplexing
- **Protocol Buffers**: Binary serialization combined with HTTP/2's binary protocol for optimal performance
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: HTTP/2 is widely supported across languages and platforms

## Performance Benefits

The combination of HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers makes gRPC significantly faster than REST APIs in many scenarios, especially for:

- High-frequency microservice communication
- Real-time streaming applications
- Mobile applications with limited bandwidth

## Conclusion

gRPC's choice of HTTP/2 reflects a thoughtful approach to modern distributed systems needs, prioritizing performance, efficiency, and developer experience over traditional REST paradigms.
